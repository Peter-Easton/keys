# Keys
This is my public key certificate information.

## PGP Public Keys
### Umbrella Signing 
My Umbrella Signing PGP Public Key Certificate has the fingerprint:

`F7A7 F207 BC90 778D 649F  67EC 53CB 8649 E324 8148`

and has the UID: `"Peter Easton (Umbrella Signer)"`

This public key certificate certifies all my genuine PGP Public Key Certificates, but is not used for anything else.

### My Personal Keys
My Personal PGP Public Key Certificate has the fingerprint: 

`F440 497D FFAF 21AE 07F4  4B68 0218 85E0 772A B1BD`

and has the UIDs: `"Peter Easton <Peter@JollyRogers.ca>"`, `"Peter Easton <Peter@JollyRoger.site"` and `"Peter Easton <JollyRoger@Mailfence.com>"`

Please note I am moving from `JollyRoger.site` to `JollyRogers.ca` because the future of the .site top-level domain is owned by a for-profit entity, and its future is uncertain and could be subject to unexpected price hikes. As a result I am moving to a .ca TLD to try to avoid this, and expect the .site E-mail address to be revoked within approximately one year. 

This public key certificate is used for Encryption, Signing, and SSH and is published to the keyservers and my github account, and should be certified by my umbrella signing certificate. 

### Previous and Retired Keys
I don't use these keys anymore but they are listed here:

`F062 8C97 9270 1397 1D20  7DA9 7714 7844 3B02 D250` 

*Final fate:* Published to keyservers. Deliberately allowed to expire on October 18th of 2018. 

*Reason:* I felt I had learned a lot more about endpoint security since, and had access to GPG hardware security tokens and a better, more trustworthy computer to generate and handle the cryptographic materials. I felt it was time to switch to new keys. 


`1012 3D41 DC15 35E1 F7EA  D060 FCD6 7614 9C00 8D69`

*Final fate:* Never published to keyservers and deliberately allowed to expire. 

*Reason:* These keys were created only as a brief, interim measure until safer keys could be created, and were discontinued over concerns with the NIST Curve safety.  

### Future Keys
In the near-future, I may be transitioning back to EdDSA keys which will be generated using a hardware wallet to further distrust general-purpose computers, for greater peace of mind. Future PGP Public Key Certificates will be certified by the current ones to signify an authorized key rollover.
